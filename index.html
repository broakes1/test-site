	The Institute of Queer Ecology is a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing queer discourse to ecology. <br/>
	Our mission is to use biology and evolution to contextualize non-normative sexualities, adaptations and presentations. <br/>
	Our programming revolves around migratory exhibitions, online publications, and a yearly journal. 
	<br/> <br/>
	We are always looking to collaborate with scientists, artists, queers, theorists, <br/> writers, designers, people, plants, and animals. 
	Interested in working with us? <br/>
	Email info@queerecology.com, and check back with this site as we continue to build it over the next few months.<br/><br/>
